name: loop-orchestrate
description: >-
  Runs several laps of the product-owner loop at once: owns the backlog, starts one session per
  independent task, settles or relays thread questions, and merges each thread's PR after the
  owner's Pass. The owner talks only to the orchestrator. Use when two or more ready tasks touch
  different feature areas and the owner accepts the parallel run offered at Stop 1, when sessions
  of an earlier run are still active, or when the owner says "orchestrate", "run these in
  parallel", "work the backlog". Not for a single task (router runs the plain loop) or one lap's
  stage work (each loop-* skill).

# loop-orchestrate

When this skill is done, every ready task has been built in its own session, and the owner has tested and decided each result from one conversation, answering only questions nobody else could. It is optional: with one ready task, the plain loop is cheaper. Decisions: `documentation/DOC_DECISION_LOG.md` § orchestrator-parallel-laps.

## Edges

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| In | `src/config/app-tasks.json`, `documentation/DOC_APP_VISION.md`, owner messages, active sessions, open lap PRs |
| Out | Thread sessions; backlog edits landed on thread PRs; one status line per turn; merged PRs |
| Calls | to rank → [`loop-backlog`](../loop-backlog/SKILL.md) steps 2–4 · threads start at → [`loop-refine`](../loop-refine/SKILL.md) · handoff format → [`loop-verdict`](../loop-verdict/SKILL.md) · on Pass → [`loop-ship`](../loop-ship/SKILL.md) · a mistake repeated across threads → [`meta-learn-lessons`](../meta-learn-lessons/SKILL.md) · when done → [`router`](../router/SKILL.md) |
| Called by | [`router`](../router/SKILL.md), [`loop-backlog`](../loop-backlog/SKILL.md) |
| Next | [`router`](../router/SKILL.md) |
| Owner stops | Yes to the run · new tasks it proposes · Stop 2 per PR · stop-list items ([`agent-behavior` rule § When to ask](../../../.claude/rules/agent-behavior.md)) it can't settle |

## Steps

1. **Orient.** List active sessions. Thread sessions tagged with a run and a lap slug, with an orchestrator as parent, mean a run is in flight: rebuild status from them and from open lap PRs.
2. **Dispatch** every ready task whose feature areas, guessed from the task text, don't overlap a running one; overlapping tasks queue. There's no cap, so token spend grows with the backlog. Start each as a separate session the owner can watch, tagged with the run and lap slug. Its brief: the task, the lap slug, run the lap from `loop-refine` to a green PR, report questions and results back, and leave `app-tasks.json` alone.
3. **Run** on every event (thread report, owner message, merge):
   - **Questions:** answer what the vision, recorded decisions or another thread settle; ask the owner the rest, one at a time ([`asking.md`](../loop-refine/references/asking.md)). A waiting thread parks; the others go on.
   - **Briefs:** when a thread reports its edges, re-check overlap; hold or re-scope a thread that overlaps or drifts. Tell a thread when another one's change affects it.
   - **Backlog:** reorder without asking and report it; turn the owner's remarks into tasks; propose tasks for gaps between the vision and the app. Start what became ready.
4. **Stop 2.** For each green PR, commit its task's archive and any pending backlog edits onto its branch, so a merge on GitHub is still a complete Pass. Then post one handoff listing each PR in the `loop-verdict` format, with a verdict per PR. On Pass, merge it; bring the other branches up to date and resolve conflicts yourself (the decision log and the backlog JSON conflict on every merge; that isn't overlap). A Change goes back to its thread; a Drop closes the PR.
5. **Finish** when nothing is ready or in flight: post the status line and hand back to the router.

Threads report back through whatever the surface supports: messages, or their branch, PR and transcript, which the orchestrator reads.

## Examples

**Example 1**
Input: "CSV export" (tasks), "Avatar in top bar" (layouts) and "Rename tasks column" (tasks); the owner says yes.
Output: two sessions start, and the rename task queues behind CSV export. The avatar thread asks which image size to use; the profile README records it, so the orchestrator answers. Later one handoff lists both previews.

## Output

One status line per turn:

```text
Running: <task> — <Building: … line until the owner saw it> · Waiting on you: <PR | question> · Queued: <task> (<reason>)
```

## Not for

| Case | Use |
|---|---|
| A single task | [`router`](../router/SKILL.md) → plain loop |
| One lap's stage work | That stage's `loop-*` skill |
